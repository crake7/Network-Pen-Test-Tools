* Note that some tools will need you to download **additional libraries**.
* If the **Useful Info** is checked, read the section below the table.

## Useful Info

Some programs may need you to be mindful of additional information. I have included some notes in this section:
   
#### `arper.py`

* Before running the script, set your machine to forward packets: `$echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` 
It is not polite to cut your target's internet connection ;)
* I suggest flushing your iptables after you have finished: `$ iptables --flush`

#### `netcat.py` 

* To run the script in **server** mode, you need to add the `-l` flag: `$ python3 netcat.py -t 10.0.0.2 -l -c`
* To run the script in **client** mode, you only need the `-t` and `-p` flags: `$python netcat.py -t 10.0.0.2 -p 5555`
* When you connect a client to a server, the script reads from your STDIN and will continue this way until it receives a end-of-file (EOF) marker. To send the EOF, press `CTRL-D`. This is specially useful when you run a shell. 


#### `proxy.py`

* The program has messed up the DNS configuration of some users. If you are having networking issues after running the script, verify your name server was not modified: `$ cat /etc/resolv.conf`
